# Excel_Bike_Report
I was created a bike sales report by making some pivot reports and thier charts which helps us to make clearly understand and helps us to analyze the data.
That how many bikes were sold which age person purchase more bikes under how many km person the person use bikes so go through the raw data and pivot reports.
So you can clearly understand the dashboard i have created.

Thanks...
